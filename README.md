# CombineBot's website!

Here is the website for [CombineBot](https://github.com/CombineSoldier14/CombineBot), my discord bot!

## Why does the site look like it was made in 2006?
Because I unironically like that style. I still wouldn't call this *good* looking, there is definetely a lot to change visually but it captures the look enough

## What about the leaderboard?
I decided that will wait until the WebUI, which will allow you to view that, your personal stats, and more. Needless to say there is a lot to do.
