        <h1>Welcome to CombineBot!</h1>
        <p>CombineBot is a Discord bot with plenty of high-quality slash commands for moderation and fun. Unlike the Combine, we aren't evil!</p>

        <h2>Hours of Fun</h2>
        <p>CombineBot's fun commands can easily keep your friend group entertained for hours, like a random reddit post from any subreddit with a full interface or taking a MBTI or Enneagram personality test, or battling your friends to earn points!</p>

        <h2>Level up!</h2>
        <p>CombineBot uses databases to keep track of our leveling/points system. By battling others, sending messages, and running commands, you can level up and get new weapons for battling, as well as climb on our leaderboard.<p>

        <h2>Moderate with Incredible Speed</h2>
        <p>CombineBot is at its core, a moderation bot. We have commands for any moderation action you can think of, whether it's creating a new channel, getting info on a role, or banning a user. You can quickly type these short commands and never touch the Discord GUI!</p>

        <h2>Utilites that can save you!</h2>
        <p>We also have many utility commands that let you get info on a user, server, or role such as their ID, join date, or avatar. All their info is readily and easily accessible for whatever you are doing! You can also interact with Discord's features in an intuitive way, like making your own embed or link button.</p>

        <h2>Don't forget to contribute!</h2>
        <p>CombineBot is written in discord.js with TypeScript and we are always open to command suggestions, bug reports, or anything else you can think of. If a command ever glitches, there is a big report button you can use to let me know.</p>
