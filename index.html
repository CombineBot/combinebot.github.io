                <h1>Welcome to CombineBot!</h1>
                <p>CombineBot is a full free and open source discord bot made by CombineSoldier14. It has 30+ slash commands for moderation and fun, perfect for any server.

                    It is updated as often as I can (when I actually know what to do that is) and is COMPLETELY free.</p>

                <h2>Hours of Fun</h2>
                <p>CombineBot's fun commands can easily keep your friend group entertained for hours, like a random reddit post from any subreddit with a full interface or taking a MBTI or Enneagram personality test, or seeing what weird shit Urban Dictionary has to  say about something.</p>

                <h2>Moderate with Incredible Speed</h2>
                <p>CombineBot is at its core, a moderation bot. We have commands for any moderation action you can think of, whether it's creating a new channel, getting info on a role, or banning a user. You can quickly type these short commands and never touch the Discord GUI!</p>

                <h2>Utilites that can save you!</h2>
                <p>We also have many utility commands that let you get info on a user, server, or role such as their ID, join date, or avatar. All their info is readily and easily accessible for whatever you are doing! You can also interact with Discord's features in an intuitive way, like making your own embed or link button.</p>

                <h2>Made for convenience!</h2>
                <p>When designing this bot, I took into account a lot of things I personally would like to see added into discord personally (such as users making embeds) and allowing people to access useful data easily from the comfort of their group chat. (APIs).</p>

                <h2>Don't forget to contribute!</h2>
                <p>CombineBot is written in discord.js with TypeScript and we are always open to command suggestions, bug reports, or anything else you can think of. If a command ever glitches, there is a big report button you can use to let me know.</p>

                <h2>Not happy? Host your own instance!</h2>
                <p>CombineBot is fully open source and so I openly support people hosting their own instances of the bot, in fact I designed the core of the bot with that in mind with the supplied Dockerfile and an easy to change info.json with bot info. So whether you want to rehaul the entire system, or you just CombineBot is a stupid name (I don't blame you), then you can easily change that for your server.</p>

                <h2>What Others have said!</h2>
